      "question": "What is a hackathon and what can I expect from it?",
      "answer": "A hackathon is a collaborative event where people come together to solve problems using technology. Work in teams to brainstorm, design, and realise a project over 24 hours, with each creation presented to a panel of judges. Prizes are awarded to the winning teams and mini-events / workshops run throughout. Hackathons are a great way to challenge yourself, learn new skills, and have a great time with new people!"

We also recommend bringing a change of clothes, toiletries, and anything else to stay comfortable during the event.
